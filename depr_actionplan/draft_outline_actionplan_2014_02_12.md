Draft Outline for Action Plan Version 2014-02-12

# National Action Plan (NAP) Draft Outline #

## 1. Introduction ##

* A paragraph explaining how involvement with the OGP is in line with the Government’s Programme and democratic values and expanding on the importance of Openness, Transparency, Accountability etc. to strengthening trust and confidence in government and public administration and also to facilitating constructive and positive dialogue with civil society and citizens. 
* Consider inclusion of quotations from the Minister and representatives of civil society on the importance of the objectives of the OGP and the contribution it can make to national renewal.  
* A paragraph or two outlining the role and involvement of civil society and the process of consultation which has seen Ireland arrive at its first action plan – a short description should be included of the civil society process including the three public meetings as well as the broader consultation process and call for submissions.
* Confirm which of the OGP grand challenges are being pursued in particular in the first NAP.  A brief justification of the choice can also be made here – for example, in line with Government policy, impact, “fit” and prioritisation. 
* A paragraph outlining that this action plan is a first step and has a central role in setting out agreed future direction of Ireland’s OGP participation and indicating the level of ambition intended for the second and subsequent NAPs.     

## 2. Open Government Efforts to Date ##

We could consider following the Croatian example and set out the main achievements we have had to date to achieve Open Government across the four key areas in the civil society report (transparency, accountability, technology & innovation, citizen participation), drawing on, for example, the two progress reports published by the Department in the last couple of years and the overview document.  These might include:
* The reform delivery programme (shared services, new and innovative service delivery channels, placing customer at the centre, efficiency reforms, accountability reform, major sectoral reforms etc.)
* Legislative reforms such as FOI, Ombudsman Act, Anti-Corruption legislation,  Oireachtas reform, planning reforms  – taking examples from across the public service 
* Citizen participation in national policy-making, in community development/planning at local level, adopting the Aarhus Convention etc.
* Measures to strengthen accountability. 

## 3. OGP Commitments ##
We could draw from the UK template and set out for each theme the following details:
* Commitment – one punchy sentence setting out what the commitment is
* Impact and vision/Context – what will the impact be?  What will success look like?  What is the business case for doing this?
* Timescales – commitment needs to be measurable.  What are key milestones for delivering it?
* Lead Department
* Civil society organisations/interests involved
* Means – what additional resources will be needed and where will they come from?
* Links to grand challenges

### Potential themes and commitments ###

#### 1. Open Data  ####

Open data has the potential to drive innovation and economic growth, improve public services, strengthen democracy, and increase transparency and accountability of government.  The G8 Open Data Charter, which was announced at the recent G8 Summit at Lough Erne, provides Ireland with a significant framework for its data-related OGP commitments.  The Charter embodies five core principles: Data should be open by default, of high quality, useable by all, contributing to improved governance, and promoting innovation. The Charter and its principles will act as a touchstone for key aspects of Ireland’s forthcoming OGP National Action plan. 
The Minister announced a suite of measures at the OGP London Summit designed to provide major impetus to OGP objectives and Open Data in Ireland. The Minister announced that Ireland commits to:
* signing up to the G8 Open Data Charter 
* appointing an Irish Open Data Board in a governance role
* building an Open Data Platform
* establishing a Steering and Implementation Group 

The Minister’s proposals comprise an integrated programme of measures to provide a major impetus to the growth and development of Open Data in Ireland that can make a major contribution to enhancing openness and transparency, strengthening public governance and has the potential to yield substantial economic benefits.

####2.	Political reform ####

* The regulation of lobbying - General Scheme of the Regulation of Lobbying Bill 2014. 

* The publication of a consultation paper on strengthening civil service accountability and performance - an extensive public consultation process has been initiated, led by the Independent Panel on Strengthening Civil Service Accountability and Performance. The aim of this process is to bring about change and reform to the current accountability arrangements. This consultation process will assess how greater clarity, certainty and common understanding can be achieved regarding who is accountable to whom for what in the Civil Service.  

* An overhaul of the ethics legislation is being progressed aimed at supporting and promoting ethical conduct, creating an environment in which ethical and conflict of interests are managed effectively and corrupt and unethical conduct are severely discouraged. This will also implement relevant recommendations contained in the Final Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments, also referred to as the Mahon Tribunal, as appropriate.

* * 1.3.4 – Improve levels of engagement with citizens – e.g. undertake organisational level surveys of customers at least once every two years.
