Open Data and Transparency – opening up Government data for greater accountability, improving public services and achieving economic growth 
Opening up Government data has the potential to drive innovation and economic growth, improve public services, and strengthen democracy, and increase transparency and accountability of government.  The integrated programme of measures to be progressed will include 
signing up to the Open Data Charter which will involve inter alia making our government data open by default and ensuring data released is not only timely but of high quality;  
identification of datasets which will have the broadest impact and highest value; and 
developing and updating a single source www.data.gov.ie from which public data can be accessed.  
Increased transparency is at the heart of the Government’s reform programme and these measures will enable the public to hold Government accountable for its performance, use data to identify best practice, encourage the public sector to improve productivity and quality and help citizens make more informed choices.  Making data available to businesses will promote development of innovative products and services and drive economic growth.  Open Data leading to more open, transparent and accountable Government is a major programme of work with the potential to reap significant benefits.

Recommendations contained in the Report of a Consultation with Civil Society Representatives and Citizens on Ireland’s Participation in the OGP which relate to this theme:


2.10, 3.01, 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, 3.06, 3.07, 3.08, 3.10, 4.04, 4.07, 4.09 



This theme also relates to aspects of a number of submissions submitted to D/PER by the following: Fingal County Council, The National Cross Industry Working Group on Open Data, Friends of the Irish Environment, Oliver Moran and the Open Knowledge Foundation.




Proposals not addressed but which were listed under the ‘Technology and Innovation’ part of the original report:

3.09 Measures to Encourage Online Participation in Government - addressed as part of section 2 “citizen participation/more active citizenship”
3.11 Public Procurement Open Days - not addressed in draft
3.12 Allow Voter Registration Online - not addressed in draft



Findings:

most of the proposals in the report have been included
all 5 submissions have also been said to be addressed through section 1 of the draft
This means we can move on to step 2 with regards to the ‘Open Data and Transparency’ theme - identifying how the commitments DPER has outlined address the original proposals and submissions

Outstanding:
Do we need to include 3.11 & 3.12 in 1st OGP Action Plan?
How do commitments in this section as formulated by DPER address the commitments originally requested by citizens during the consultations = step 2 assessment
how do we measure success - what do we want out of doing these things at the end of the day?
